Thousand Foot Krutch â€” Phenomenon

If you're like us, calling all riders, roll up beside us, no place to hide us
All freedom fighters, let's unite us, switch on your nitrous and...let's.. go...
Destination, for navigation, man up ya station, feel the sensation surround invasion,
With communication, move quick, we might avoid contamination
[Chorus:]
Down, here comes the sound, everyone pound your feet to this phenomenon,
Now let's make it loud, let's show 'em all how you move to this phenomenon,
Roll! Open your soul, maybe lose control inside of this phenomenon,
just let yourself go, and let everyone know you move to this phenomenon

Don't let these spiders crawl up beside us, they want to bite us, inject the virus.
Raise up the lighters, praise to the righteous, we need to guide us, get...prepared..
To.. go..if you're like us, calling all riders, roll up beside us, no place to hide us,
all freedom fighters, let's unite us, switch on your nitrous.. and.. let's.. go..

[Chorus]

Can't take it anymore, shake until we move the floor, what are we waiting for? Let's go!
I'm tired of being ordinary, don't care if there's people staring, I'll rely on your strength to carry me on.
I'm not invisible like you, next time things get a little messed up, I'll shine,
But I'll never be see through. I'm fine just trying to wake the rest up

[Chorus]
